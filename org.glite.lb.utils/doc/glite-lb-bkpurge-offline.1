.SH NAME
glite-lb-bkpurge-offline - emergency utility for removing inactive jobs from the L&B database


.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBglite-lb-bkpurge-offline\fR [\fIOPTIONS\fR]


.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBglite-lb-bkpurge-offline\fR is utility for removing inactive jobs from the L&B database. By default, it removes jobs that reached CLEARED, ABORTED and CANCELED state and also OTHER and DONE jobs that are inactive for specific (rather long) time. It calls directly database SQL commands.

This utility is provided for \fBemergency and expert use only\fR. Exact semantics of job age are slightly different from regular \fBglite-lb-bkpurge\fR, there is no synchronization with running L&B server and/or proxy when jobs receive new events while being purged, and error handling is minimal.
