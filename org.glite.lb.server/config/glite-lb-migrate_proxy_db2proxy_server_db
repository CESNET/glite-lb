# This script is intendent to be used to extend proxy database to 
# to be able to hold both bkserver and lbproxy jobs.
# The operation should be non-destructive, i.e. all data should persist
# and continue to be fully usable.

#!/bin/bash


# add columns for job membership (proxy/server) flags
mysql -u lbserver lbproxy -e "ALTER TABLE jobs ADD proxy bool not null"
mysql -u lbserver lbproxy -e "ALTER TABLE jobs ADD server bool not null"

# flag all jobs as proxy jobs
mysql -u lbserver lbproxy -e "update jobs set proxy='1'"
mysql -u lbserver lbproxy -e "update jobs set server='0'"

# something more clever should come here
#	- rename DB to lbserver20
#	- or copy all fields to lbserver20 DB
