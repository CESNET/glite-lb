These are the instructions how to build LB for VDT:

$ mkdir lb4vdt
$ cd lb4vdt
$ export CVSROOT=:pserver:anonymous@jra1mw.cvs.cern.ch:/cvs/jra1mw  
$ cvs co org.glite.lb                                                     

you may need to edit ./org.glite.lb/lb4vdt/Makefile.inc     
to specify some paths (some of them should be set automaticaly,  
e.g. by VDT_LOCATION)

and then (still from the top directory) run

$ ./org.glite.lb/lb4vdt/LB_install.sh 2>&1 | tee log

:)
