Requirements
============

1) gLite
- client L&B libraries:
  - glite-jobid-api-c
  - glite-lb-common
  - glite-lb-client
  - glite-security-gss
  - globus essential libraries (threaded flavour),
    use the vesion with the external SSL, not with bundled SSL (!)
 - glite-lbjp-common-db (build only)
 - mysql-devel (build only)
2) postgresql-devel


Steps
=====

./configure
make
make install

Use './configure --help' for the options.


Manual way
==========

configure is simple script generating Makefile.inc. You can build harvester
straight away by make defining the variables manually. For example with gLite
installed in ~/glite/stage:

(rm Makefile.inc)
make stagedir=$HOME/glite/stage


Testing
=======

Test for basic functionality covered by 'test.sh' script in sources.
See './test.sh --help'.
