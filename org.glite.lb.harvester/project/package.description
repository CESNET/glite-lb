L&B Harvester gathers information about jobs from L&B servers using effective L&B notification mechanism. It manages notifications and keeps them in a persistent storage (file or database table) to reuse later on next launch. It takes care about refreshing notifications and queries L&B servers back when some notification expires.

The tool was initially written for Real Time Monitor (project at Imperial College in London), later was extended with messaging mechanism for WLCG.
