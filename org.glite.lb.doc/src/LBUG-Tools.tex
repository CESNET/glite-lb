\section{Tools description}
\label{s:lb-tools}

In this section we give a description of the tools that are installed
together with the \verb'glite-lb-client' RPM. These tools are \LB-specific.
Besides these tools, \verb'glite-wms-job-status' and \verb'glite-wms-job-logging-info' available 
in \verb'glite-wms-ui-cli-python' RPM, provide more information about user jobs and corresponding events.

Behaviour of \verb'glite-lb-*' commands can be changed by setting the following enviroment variables:
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{lX}
GLITE\_WMS\_LOG\_DESTINATION & address of \verb'glite-lb-logd' daemon, in form \verb'hostname:port'\\
GLITE\_WMS\_LOG\_TIMEOUT & timeout (in seconds) for asynchronous logging\\
GLITE\_WMS\_LOG\_SYNC\_TIMEOUT & timeout (in seconds) for synchronous logging\\
GLITE\_WMS\_NOTIF\_SERVER& address of \verb'glite-lb-bkserver' daemon, in form \verb'hostname:port'\\
GLITE\_WMS\_NOTIF\_TIMEOUT& timeout (in seconds) for notification registration\\
X509\_USER\_CERT and X509\_USER\_KEY & location of user credentials\\
\end{tabularx}
For backward compatibility, all \verb'GLITE\_WMS\_*' variables can be prefixed by \verb'EDG\_WL\_' instead.

\subsection{Other useful tools}
\label{glite-lb-other}

For debugging purposes, low-level commands for getting \LB job status and job related events are provided in 
\verb'examples' directory (\verb'glite-lb-job-status' and \verb'glite-lb-job-log'). The same directory
contains also debugging commands for getting of all user jobs (\verb'glite-lb-user\_jobs') and
CE-reputability rank (see Section \ref{s:ce-rank}, \verb'glite-lb-stats').
