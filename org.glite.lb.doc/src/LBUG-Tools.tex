\section{User tools}
\label{s:lb-tools}

In this section we give a description of the CLI tools that a regular grid user
might want to use. If not stated otherwise, the tools are distributed in the
\verb'glite-lb-client' package.

\subsection{Environment variables}

Behaviour of the commands can be changed by setting enviroment variables, specifing mostly
location of servers or setting timeouts for various operations. 
For a complete list of environment variables, their form and default value
description, see Appendix~\ref{a:environment}. Setting the environment variable
is for some commands mandatory, so reading the documentaion below and
appropriate manpages is highly recommended.


\subsection{glite-wms-job-status and glite-wms-job-logging-info}

We start with tools that are distributed in \verb'glite-wms-ui-cli-python' package
and that can be found probably on all UI machines. Description of all user
commands that are used during the job submission process (generating proxy,
creating a JDL describing the job, submitting a job, retrieving output,
cancelling a job, etc.) is beoynd this document and it can be found for example
in \cite{wmsug}. We mention here only the commands that are related to
job monitoring.

Once job has been submitted to WMS (by \verb'glite-wms-job-submit'), 
a user can retrieve the job status by
\begin{verbatim}
    glite-wms-job-status <jobId>
\end{verbatim}
or if job ID is saved in the file
\begin{verbatim}
    glite-wms-job-status -i <job_id_file>
\end{verbatim}
or if user wants to see status of all his/her jobs
\begin{verbatim}
    glite-wms-job-status --all
\end{verbatim}
List of all possible job states is summarised in Appendix \ref{a:jobstat}.

Logging details on submitted job can be accessed via
\begin{verbatim}
    glite-wms-job-logging-info -v <verbosity_level> <job_ID>
\end{verbatim}
or if job ID is saved in the file
\begin{verbatim}
   glite-wms-job-logging-info -v <verbosity_level> -i <job_id_file>
\end{verbatim}
where verbosity level can be from 0 to 3. 


\input{logevent}

\input{notify}


\subsection{HTML and plain text interface}
\label{simple}
Since the gLite jobId has the form of a unique URL, it is possible to cut and paste it directly
to the web browser to view the information about the job (esp. its status), e.g.
\begin{verbatim}
  firefox https://pelargir.ics.muni.cz:9000/1234567890
\end{verbatim}
To list all user's jobs, it is possible to query only the \LB server address, e.g.
\begin{verbatim}
  firefox https://pelargir.ics.muni.cz:9000
\end{verbatim}
To list all user's notification registration curently valid on a given \LB server, use a URL constructed as in folowing example:
\begin{verbatim}
  firefox https://pelargir.ics.muni.cz:9000/NOTIF
\end{verbatim}
A notification ID also have a form of URL. If you direct your browser to a particular notification ID, the \LB server will provide the notification details for it.
\begin{verbatim}
  firefox https://pelargir.ics.muni.cz:9000/NOTIF:1234567890
\end{verbatim}
In all cases it is necessary to have the user certificate installed in the browser.


Since \LBnew, it is also possible to obtain the above results in a machine readable 
\verb'key=value' form by adding a suffix \verb'text' to the above URLs. For example
\begin{verbatim}
  curl -3 --key $X509_USER_KEY --cert $X509_USER_CERT \
    --capath /etc/grid-security/certificates \ 
    https://pelargir.ics.muni.cz:9000?text
\end{verbatim}
or
\begin{verbatim}
  curl -3 --key $X509_USER_KEY --cert $X509_USER_CERT \
    --capath /etc/grid-security/certificates \ 
    https://pelargir.ics.muni.cz:9000/1234567890?text
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Job state changes as an RSS feed}
The \LB includes an RSS interface allowing users to keep trace of their jobs in a very simple way using an RSS reader. The parameters of the RSS feeds are predefined, so no configuration is required.

The address of a feed is given by the URL of the \LB server and a \textit{/RSS:rss\_feed\_name} postfix, e.g.
\begin{verbatim}
   https://pelargir.ics.muni.cz:9000/RSS:finished
\end{verbatim}  

There are currently 3 feeds implemented in LB:
\begin{itemize}
 \item \textit{finished} for jobs in terminal states (Done/OK, Aborted and Canceled)
 \item \textit{running} for running jobs
 \item \textit{aborted} for aborted jobs
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Other useful tools}

For debugging purposes, low-level commands for getting \LB job status and job related events are provided in 
\verb'examples' directory (\verb'glite-lb-job_status' and \verb'glite-lb-job_log'). The same directory
contains also debugging commands for getting of all user jobs (\verb'glite-lb-user_jobs') and
CE-reputability rank (see Section \ref{s:ce-rank}, \verb'glite-lb-stats').
