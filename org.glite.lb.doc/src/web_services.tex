\section{Using \LB\ Web Service}

\TODO{Complete review, list of all relevant (WSDL) files, their location, etc.}

The \LB\ web service interface currently reflects the functionality of legacy
\LB\ Querying API (Sect.~\ref{Consumer-API}).

The following sections describe the operations defined in the \LB\ WSDL
file as well as its custom types.

For the sake of readability this documentation does not follow the structure
of WSDL strictly, avoiding to duplicate information which is already present
here. Consequently, the SOAP messages are not documented, for example, as they
are derived from operation inputs and outputs mechanically.
The same holds for types: \eg\ we do not document defined elements
which correspond 1:1 to types but are required due to the literal SOAP
encoding.

For exact definition of the operations and types see the WSDL file.

\TODO{Add fully functional WS examples - in Java, Python, C?}
