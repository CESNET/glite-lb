 machines (\LB server, ...), environment variables set, etc.
\item output from the following commands:
\begin{verbatim}
   glite-wms-job-status <jobId>
   glite-wms-job-logging-info -v 3 <jobID>
\end{verbatim}
\item information on your proxy:
\begin{verbatim}
   voms-proxy-info -debug -all
\end{verbatim}
or, if VOMS client is not installed, 
\begin{verbatim}

\end{verbatim}
that should be available in the \verb'$GLITE_LOCATION/examples' directory,
