\section{Troubleshooting}

Please, report usage problems via the GGUS support system at

\end{center}
Apparent software bugs are tracked in Savannah at

When submitting a \LB specific problem/bug, the following information might be useful:
\begin{itemize}
\item version of software used (all \verb'glite-lb-*' packages installed at your site)
\item description of the problem, the \verb'jobId', addresses of all relevant
 machines (\LB server, ...), environment variables set, etc.
\item output from the following commands:
\begin{verbatim}
   glite-wms-job-status <jobId>
   glite-wms-job-logging-info -v 3 <jobID>
\end{verbatim}
\item information on your proxy:
\begin{verbatim}
   voms-proxy-info -debug -all
\end{verbatim}
or, if VOMS client is not installed, 
\begin{verbatim}
   grid-proxy-info -debug 
\end{verbatim}
\item sometimes additional information can be found in the output from the commands
\begin{verbatim}
   glite-lb-job_status <jobId>
   glite-lb-job_log <jobId>
\end{verbatim}
that should be available in the \verb'$GLITE_LOCATION/examples' directory,
\item appropriate excerpts from the logs on the server side are also highly appreciated, 
please tell your administrator to look at the Troubleshooting section in LB Administrator's 
Guide \cite{lbag} to follow the steps there and provide you the necessary information.
