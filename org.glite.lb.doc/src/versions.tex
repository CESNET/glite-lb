The Logging and Bookkeeping service (\LB\ for short) was initially developed in
the EU DataGrid
project\footnote{\url{http://eu-datagrid.web.cern.ch/eu-datagrid/}} as a~part
of the Workload Management System (WMS). The development continued in the EGEE,
EGEE-II and EGEE-III projects,\footnote{\url{http://www.eu-egee.org/}} where
\LB became an independent part of the
gLite\footnote{\url{http://www.glite.org}} middleware~\cite{glite}, and then in the EMI Project.\footnote{\url{http://www.eu-emi.eu/}}

The complete \LB Documentation consists of the following parts:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{\LB User's Guide} 
   \ifx\insideUG\undefined{\cite{lbug}}\else{- this document}\fi. 
   \input{LBUG-Abstract}
\item \textbf{\LB Administrator's Guide} 
   \ifx\insideAG\undefined{\cite{lbag}}\else{- this document}\fi. 
   \input{LBAG-Abstract}
\item \textbf{\LB Developer's Guide} 
   \ifx\insideDG\undefined{\cite{lbdg}}\else{- this document}\fi. 
   \input{LBDG-Abstract}
\item \textbf{\LB Test Plan} 
   \ifx\insideTP\undefined{\cite{lbtp}}\else{- this document}\fi. 
   \input{LBTP-Abstract}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{The following versions of \LB service are covered by these documents:}
\begin{itemize}
%\item \LBver{x.x}: included in the EMI-3 Monte Bianco release
\item \LBver{3.2}: included in the EMI-2 Matterhorn release
\item \LBver{3.1}: an update for the EMI-1 Kebnekaise release
\item \LBver{3.0}: included in the EMI-1 Kebnekaise release
\item \LBver{2.1}: replacement for \LBver{2.0} in gLite 3.2,
\item \LBver{2.0}: current stable version, in production as part of gLite 3.2,
\item \LBver{1.x}: old stable version, in production as part of gLite 3.1.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{The older version of \LB that appeared in gLite 3.0 became obsolete and is not maintained anymore.}

\textbf{\LB packages can be obtained from two distinguished sources:}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{gLite releases}: gLite node-type repositories, offering a specific repository for each node type such as \emph{glite-LB}
\item \textbf{emi releases}: EMI repository or EGI's UMD repository, offering all EMI middleware packages from a single repository and relying on EPEL for dependencies
\end{itemize}

\emph{Note:} Despite offering the same functionality, binary packages obtained from different repositories differ and switching from one to the other for upgrades may not be altogether straightforward.

Updated information about \LB service (including the \LB service roadmap) is available at the
