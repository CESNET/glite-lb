The Logging and Bookkeeping service (\LB\ for short) was initially developed in
the EU DataGrid
project\footnote{\url{http://eu-datagrid.web.cern.ch/eu-datagrid/}} as a~part
of the Workload Management System (WMS). The development continued in the EGEE,
EGEE-II and EGEE-III projects,\footnote{\url{http://www.eu-egee.org/}} where
\LB became an independent part of the
gLite\footnote{\url{http://www.glite.org}} middleware~\cite{glite}.

\textbf{Two major versions of \LB service are covered by this document -- \LBold, 
which was included in gLite 3.1, and current \LBnew that is part of gLite 3.2. 
The older version of \LB that appeared in gLite 3.0 became obsolete and is not maintained anymore.}
