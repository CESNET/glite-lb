The Logging and Bookkeeping service (\LB\ for short) was initially developed in
the EU DataGrid
project\footnote{\url{http://eu-datagrid.web.cern.ch/eu-datagrid/}} as a~part
of the Workload Management System (WMS). The development continued in the EGEE,
EGEE-II and EGEE-III projects,\footnote{\url{http://www.eu-egee.org/}} where
\LB became an independent part of the
gLite\footnote{\url{http://www.glite.org}} middleware~\cite{glite}, and then in the EMI Project.\footnote{\url{http://www.eu-emi.eu/}}

The complete \LB Documentation consists of the following parts:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{\LB User's Guide} 
   \ifx\insideUG\undefined{\cite{lbug}}\else{-- this document}\fi. 
   \input{LBUG-Abstract}
\item \textbf{\LB Administrator's Guide} 
   \ifx\insideAG\undefined{\cite{lbag}}\else{-- this document}\fi. 
   \input{LBAG-Abstract}
\item \textbf{\LB Developer's Guide} 
   \ifx\insideDG\undefined{\cite{lbdg}}\else{-- this document}\fi. 
   \input{LBDG-Abstract}
\item \textbf{\LB Test Plan} 
   \ifx\insideTP\undefined{\cite{lbtp}}\else{-- this document}\fi. 
   \input{LBTP-Abstract}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{The following versions of \LB service are covered by these documents:}
\begin{itemize}
%\item \LBver{x.x}: included in the EMI-3 \emph{Monte Bianco} release
\item \LBver{3.2}: included in the EMI-2 \emph{Matterhorn} release
\item \LBver{3.1}: an update for the EMI-1 \emph{Kebnekaise} release
\item \LBver{3.0}: included in the EMI-1 \emph{Kebnekaise} release
\item \LBver{2.1}: replacement for \LBver{2.0} in gLite 3.2
\item \LBver{2.0}: included in gLite 3.2 release
\item \LBver{1.x}: included in gLite 3.1 release
\end{itemize}

\textbf{\LB packages can be obtained from two distinguished sources:}

\nopagebreak
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{gLite releases}: gLite node-type repositories, offering a specific repository for each node type such as \emph{glite-LB}. Only binary RPM packages are available from that source.
\item \textbf{emi releases}: EMI repository\footnote{\url{http://emisoft.web.cern.ch/emisoft/}} or EGI's UMD repository,\footnote{\url{http://repository.egi.eu/}} offering all EMI middleware packages from a single repository. There are RPM packages, both source and binary, the latter relying on EPEL for dependencies. There are also DEB packages (starting with EMI-2) and \texttt{tar.gz} archives.
\end{itemize}

\emph{Note:} Despite offering the same functionality, binary packages obtained from different repositories differ and switching from one to the other for upgrades may not be altogether straightforward.

Updated information about \LB service (including the \LB service roadmap) is available at the
