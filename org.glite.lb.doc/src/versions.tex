The Logging and Bookkeeping service (\LB\ for short) was initially developed in
the EU DataGrid
project\footnote{\url{http://eu-datagrid.web.cern.ch/eu-datagrid/}} as a~part
of the Workload Management System (WMS). The development continued in the EGEE,
EGEE-II and EGEE-III projects,\footnote{\url{http://www.eu-egee.org/}} where
\LB became an independent part of the
gLite\footnote{\url{http://www.glite.org}} middleware~\cite{glite}.

The complete \LB Documentation consists of the following parts:
\begin{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\textbf{The following versions of \LB service are covered by these documents:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \LBver{3.0}: included in the EMI-1 Kebnekaise release
\item \LBver{2.1}: replacement for \LBver{2.0} in gLite 3.2,
\item \LBver{2.0}: current stable version, in production as part of gLite 3.2,
\item \LBver{1.x}: old stable version, in production as part of gLite 3.1.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{The older version of \LB that appeared in gLite 3.0 became obsolete and is not maintained anymore.}
