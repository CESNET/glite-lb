\section{Quickstart Guide}
% The quickstart guide should explain in simple terms and with examples
% how a user is supposed to achieve the most common usecases. E.g. how
% to submit and cancel a job, how to receive a job's output. How to
% create a grid file, move it around, locate it, and delete it. How to
% monitor the progress on an application etc.
