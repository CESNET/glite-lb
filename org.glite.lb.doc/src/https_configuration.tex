\subsubsection{Reading \LB Server Configuration over HTTPs}

As of \LBver{3.0}, it is also possible to use the HTTPs interface to retrieve essential information on \LB Server configuration. For example:
\begin{verbatim}
  firefox https://pelargir.ics.muni.cz:9000/?configuration
\end{verbatim}

Among others, the following fields may be discerned from the URL:

\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{lX}
\label{s:findbroker}
\texttt{msg\_brokers} & A list of messaging brokers that \LB server uses to deliver messages.\\
\texttt{msg\_prefixes} & A list of permissible prefixes that must be used in messaging topics.\\
\end{tabularx}
