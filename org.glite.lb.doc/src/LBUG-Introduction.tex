\section{Introduction}
%This Section should give a brief summary of what the service described
%is supposed to achieve and how it fits into the overall
%architecture. It should contain subsections on the service internal
%architecture and its relations to other services. 

The Logging and Bookkeeping (\LB) service tracks jobs managed by 
the gLite WMS (workload management system).
It gathers events from various WMS components in a~reliable way
and processes them in order to give a~higher level view, the
\emph{status of job}.

Virtually all the important
data are fed to \LB\ internally from various gLite middleware
components, transparently from the user's point of view.
On the contrary, \LB\ provides public interfaces for querying the job
information synchronously as well as registering for asynchronous
notifications.
API's for this functionality are described in this document in detail.
