\section{Maintenance}

\subsection{\LB server}

This section deals with several typical but more peculiar tasks
that need more verbose description.
It is complemented with the full commands reference that is provided
as standard manual pages installed with the \LB packages.

\subsubsection{Standard and debug logs}

In normal operation \LB server sends error messages to syslog.
Informational messages are generally avoided in order to prevent syslog congestion.

\begin{sloppypar}
When tracing problems, GLITE\_LB\_SERVER\_DEBUG environment variable can be set to
non-empty value when starting the service.
Then verbose log \$GLITE\_LOCATION\_VAR/lb.log 
(as well as \$GLITE\_LOCATION\_VAR/notif-il.log eventually when notifications are enabled).
Beware that these can grow huge easily.
\end{sloppypar}

\subsubsection{Changing index configuration}

% full-scan skodi, LB se tomu brani
Inefficient queries, yielding full scan of \LB database tables (up to millions of tuples) would degrade server performance.
Therefore \LB does not allow arbitrary queries in general
(server option \verb'--no-index' can change this behaviour).
On the contrary, a~query has to hit a~\emph{job index}, build on one or
more job attributes.
It is left up to the specific \LB server administrator to decide
which job attributes are selective enough to be indexed and allow queries
(\eg for many-users communities job owner can be a~sufficient criterion;
for others, where only a~few users submit thousands of jobs, it is not).

% indexy  -- implementace jako extra sloupce => zmeny offline, konfigurace
% olizovana z DB
Technically, job indices are implemented via dedicated columns
in a~database table.
These columns and their indices are scanned by the \LB server on startup,
therefore there is no specific configuration file.
Changing the index configuration is rather heavyweight operation
(depending on the number of jobs in the database), it performs
updates of all tuples in general, and it should be done when the server is not
running.

% utilitka bkindex -- pouziti
Indices are manipulated with a~standalone utility \verb'glite-lb-bkindex'
(see its man page for complete usage reference).
A~general sequence of changing the indices is:
\begin{enumerate}
\item stop the running server
\item retrieve current index configuration
\begin{quote}
\verb'glite-lb-bkindex -d >index_file'
\end{quote}
\item edit \verb'index_file' appropriately
\item re-index the database (it may take long time)
\begin{quote}
\verb'glite-lb-bkindex -r -v index_file'
\end{quote}
\verb'-r' stands for ``really do it'', \verb'-v' is ``be verbose''
\item start the server again
\end{enumerate}

% format vstupniho souboru
The index description file follows the classad format, having the following grammar:
\begin{quote}
\emph{IndexFile} ::= [ JobIndices = \{ \emph{IndexList} \} ] \\
\emph{IndexList} ::= \emph{IndexDef} $|$ \emph{IndexDef}, \emph{IndexList} \\
\emph{IndexDef} ::= \emph{IndexColumn} $|$ \emph{ComplexIndex} \\
\emph{IndexColumn} ::= [ type = "\emph{IndexType}"; name = "\emph{IndexName}" ]\\
\emph{ComplexIndex} ::= \{ \emph{ColumnList} \} \\
\emph{ColumnList} ::= \emph{IndexColumn} $|$ \emph{IndexColumn}, \emph{ColumnList}
\end{quote}

where eligible \emph{IndexType}, \emph{IndexName} combinations are given
in Tab.~\ref{t:indexcols}.
A~template index configuration, containing indices on the most frequently
used attributes, can be found in /opt/glite/etc/glite-lb-index.conf.template.

\subsubsection{Multiple server instances}

% lze to, i nad jednou databazi, zadna automaticka podpora

Specific conditions (\eg debugging, different authorization setup, \dots)
may require running multiple \LB server instances
on the same machine.
Such setup is available, however, there is no specific support in automated
configuration, the additional non-default server instances must be run manually.

The other server instance must use different ports (changed with \verb'-p'
and \verb'-w' options), as well as use different pid file (\verb'-i' option).

The servers may or may not share the database (non-default is specified
with  \verb'-m')%
\footnote{Even when sharing the database, the servers are still 
partially isolated from
one another, \eg a~job \url{https://my.machine:9000/xyz} cannot be queried 
as \url{https://my.machine:8000/xyz}.
However, due to implementation internals, the second job cannot be registered.}.

\subsubsection{Backup dumps}

(This functionality should not be confused with per-job dumps, Sect.~\ref{inst:purge} and \ref{run:purge}.)

Besides setting up \LB server database on a~reliable storage or
backing it up directly (Sect.~\ref{inst:backup})
\LB server supports backing up only incremental changes in the data.
Advantages of this approach are lower volume of data to be backed up,
and possibility to load them to another instance (\eg for heavyweight
queries which should not disturb normal operation), disadvantage is
a~more complex and more fragile setup. 

Using an external utility \verb'glite-lb-dump' (typical invocation is with
a~single option \verb'-m' \emph{my.server.name:port}, see man page for
details) the server is triggered to dump events, which arrived in
a~specified time interval, into a~text file. (Default interval is from last
dump till the current time.)

\verb'glite-lb-dump' is a~standalone client program, however, 
the events are stored at server side (\ie not transferred to the client,
due to performance reasons),
in a~uniquely named text
file prefixed with the value of \verb'-D' server option. This kind of dump
contains events according to their arrival time, regardless of jobs they belong
to.

It is sufficient to run the dump regularly (from a~cron job), with a~frequency
matching an acceptable risk of loosing data (several hours typically), and back
up the resulting dump files. 

In the event of server crash, its database should be recreated empty,
and the server started up.
Then the dump files can be loaded back with complementary
\verb'glite-lb-load' utility.

Server superuser privileges (X509 credentials) are required to run \verb'glite-lb-dump' and \verb'glite-lb-load'.
Dumping the events does not interfere with normal server operation.

This backup strategy can interfere with too aggressive setting of old
data purging (Sect.~\ref{run:purge}), 
If the purging grace period is shorter than the dump interval,
events may get purged before they are captured by the backup dump.
However, this interference is unlikely (reasonable purge grace period
is several times longer than dump period),
and it is not fatal in general (data were purged on purpose either).

\subsubsection{Purging and processing old data}
\label{run:purge}

Primary purpose of the LB purge operation  is removal of aged data from LB database. This is necessary in
production in order to prevent ever-increasing database and sustain reasonable
performance of the server. Therefore the purge should be invoked periodically.

The purge operation has additional important ``side effect'' -- dumping the
purged data into a plain text file. These dumps can be archived ``as is'' or
uploaded to Job Provenance. 

\paragraph{Purge setup}

The purge operation itself is performed by a~running \LB server
(there is no need to shut it down, then).
However, it is triggered with \verb'glite-lb-purge' client command
(complete usage reference is given in its man page).
A~typical invocation specifies \LB server to purge (\verb'-m' option),
and purge timeouts (grace periods) for several job states -- options
\verb'-a' (aborted), \verb'-n' (canceled), \verb'-c' (cleared), and
\verb'-o' (other).
A~job falling in one of the four categories is purged when it has not been
touched (\ie an event arrived) for time longer than the specified category
timeout.
Suggested values are several days for aborted and canceled jobs,
and one day for cleared jobs, however, the values may strongly vary
with \LB server policy.

Optionally, \verb'-s' purge command option instructs the server to
dump the purged data into a~file at the server side.
It's location (prefix) is given by \verb'-S' server option,
the purge command reports a~specific file name on its output.

It is recommended (and the default YAIM setup does so, via
the \verb'glite-lb-export.sh' wrapper) to run the purge
command periodically from cron.

Server superuser privileges (X509 credentials) are required to run \verb'glite-lb-purge'.

If the server database has already grown huge, the purge operation can take
rather long and hit the \LB server operation timeout. At client side, \ie the
glite-lb-purge command, it can be increased by setting GLITE\_WMS\_QUERY\_TIMEOUT
environment variable.

Sometimes hardcoded server-side timeout can be still reached; in this case the
server fails to return a correct response but the purge is done anyway. 

\textbf{\LBnew only}: option \verb'-x' allows purging \LB proxy database too.

\paragraph{Emergency purge}

When regular purge was not invoked for some time, it may happen that 
the database grows huge and the regular (on-line) purge fails.
In order to work around such situation we provide an off-line emergency
purge script \verb'glite-lb-bkpurge-offline.sh'

The script accepts the same \verb'-acno' options, and adds \verb'-d' for ``done'' jobs. 
Via \verb'-p' also \LB proxy database can be purged (all \LB versions).

On startup, a~warning message is printed and interactive confirmation
requested.
Re-check that \LB server (proxy) is not running, and carry on only when you
know what you are doing.

\paragraph{Post-mortem statistics}

\TODO{honik}

\paragraph{Export to Job Provenance}

An important, though currently optional, processing of \LB dumps
is their upload to the Job Provenance service for permanent preservation
of the data.


When enabled (via configuration environment variables, see bellow), 
the export is done in two steps:
\begin{itemize}
\item \verb'glite-lb-export.sh' wrapper script, after calling \verb'glite-lb-purge', breaks up the resulting dump file on a~per-job basis.
The individual job dump files are stored in a~dedicated spool directory.
\item \verb'glite-jp-importer' daemon (installed optionally in glite-jp-client.rpm) checks the spool directory periodically,
and tries to upload the files into JP.
\end{itemize}

Details, including the configuration variables, are covered at the following
wiki page:
\url{http://egee.cesnet.cz/mediawiki/index.php/LB_purge_and_export_to_JP}.

The logger component (implemented by \verb'glite-lb-interlogd' daemon fed by
either \verb'glite-lb-logd' or \LB proxy)
is responsible for the store-and-forward event delivery in \LB
(Sect~\ref{comp:logger}).
Therefore eventual operational problems are related mostly to 
cumulating undelivered events.

\subsubsection{Event files}

\LB logger stores events in one file per job, named
\verb'$GLITE_LOCATION_VAR/log/dglogd.log.JOBID' by default
(JOBID is only the part after the \LB server address prefix).
The format is text (ULM~\cite{ulm}), one event per line.
In addition, control information on delivery status is stored in additional
file with \verb'.ctl' suffix.

\begin{sloppypar}
In case of emergency (\eg corrupted file) the files can be examined
with \verb'glite-lb-parse_eventsfile'%
\footnote{Not fully supported tool, installed by glite-lb-client RPM among examples.}.
It is possible to hand-edit the event files in emergency (remove corrupted lines).
However, glite-lb-interlogd must not be running, and the corresponding .ctl file
must be removed.
\end{sloppypar}

\subsubsection{Backlog reasons}

\paragraph{Undeliverable jobid.}
In normal gLite job processing, jobids are verified on job submission
(via synchronous job registration, see~\cite{lbug}), hence occurrence of
undeliverable jobid (\ie its prefix does not point to
a~working \LB server) is unlikely.
On the other hand, if it happens,
and an event with such a~jobid is logged,
\eg due to a~third-party job processing software bug,
glite-lb-interlogd keeps trying to deliver it indefinitely%
\footnote{Unless event expiration is set, though it is not done for normal events.}.
The unsuccessful attempts are reported via syslog.
The only solution is manual
removal of the corresponding files
and restart of the service.

\paragraph{Corrupted event file.} 
For various reasons the files may get corrupted.
In general, corrupted file is detected by glite-lb-interlogd, and it is moved
to \emph{quarantine} (by renaming the file to contain ``quarantine'' in its name).
The action is reported in syslog.
The renamed files can be removed or repaired by hand and renamed back
for glite-lb-interlogd to pick them up again
(in this case, the service needn't be stopped).

\paragraph{Slow delivery.}
Either glite-lb-interlogd or the target \LB server(s) may not keep pace 
with the incoming stream of events.
Unless the situation is permanent, no specific action is required---the 
event backlog decreases once the source is drained.
Otherwise hardware bottlenecks (CPU, disk, network) have to be identified
(with standard OS monitoring) and removed.

\TODO{salvet -- nemame jeste nejake rychle tipy?}


\subsubsection{Notification delivery}
\begin{sloppypar}
When glite-lb-logger RPM is optionally installed with \LB server, 
a~modified \verb'glite-lb-notif-interlogd' is run by the server startup
script.
This version of the daemon is specialized for \LB notifications delivery;
it uses the same mechanism, however, the events (notifications) are routed
by \emph{notification id} rather than jobid, and targeted to user's listeners,
not \LB servers.
See~\cite{lbug, lbdg} for details.
\end{sloppypar}

On the contrary to normal events, it is more likely that the event destination
disappears permanently.
Therefore the notification events have their expiration time set,
and glite-lb-interlogd purges expired undelivered notifications by default.
Therefore the need for manual purge is even less likely.

The event files have different prefix (\verb'/var/tmp/glite-lb-notif' by default).

\subsubsection{Debug mode}

All the logger daemons, \ie glite-lb-logd, glite-lb-interlogd, and
glite-lb-notif-interlogd, can be started with \verb'-d' 
to avoid detaching control terminal, and \verb'-v' to increase 
debug message verbosity.
See manual pages for details.
