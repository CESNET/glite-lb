\section{Introduction}

This document explains how to test the \LB service. Tests are described at six different layers, from elementary tests
if the service is up and running, through tests of the fully supported functionality,
performance and stress tests to interoperability tests.

\TODO{add some more introduction}


\subsection{Test Categories}
Several layers of tests are considered:

\begin{description}
\item[Layer 1 - service ping tests:] Basic test if a service is up and running.
\item[Layer 2 - service functionality tests:] Test the fully supported functionality of a service. This includes also service interface tests.
\item[Layer 3 - system tests:] Test a complete system that traverses multiple services.
\item[Layer 4 - stress tests:] Stress test services and systems (including long running jobs to check for resource leaks).
\item[Layer 5 - performance tests:] Test performance of the service (including the MegaJob results).
\item[Layer 6 - interoperability tests:] Test for interoperability with other grids (might be interactive).
\end{description}
