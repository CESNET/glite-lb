\subsection{\LB server}

\subsubsection{Hardware requirements}

Hardware requirements depend on performance and storage time requirements.
Disk space used by LB server consists of database space and working space 
for backup dumps and temporary files used by exports to Job Provenance and
R-GMA tables. Necessary database space can be calculated by multiplying 
job retention length (job purge timeout), job submission rate, and  
per-job space requirements (120\,KB per job is recommended for current common 
EGEE usage pattern; jobs can consume more than that with use of very long
JDL descriptions, user tags, or very high number of resubmissions).
For temporary files, approximately 10\,GB is sufficient for LB server setups
working normally, more can be needed when backlog forms in data export
to any external service. For example, typical setup processing 40\,000 jobs per 
day where all jobs are purged after 10 days needs about 58
($0.000000120\cdot 40000\cdot 10 + 10$) gigabytes (not accounting for operating 
system and system logs).

For smooth handling of 40\,000 jobs/day, this or better machine configuration 
is necessary:
\begin{itemize}
\item 1GB RAM
\item CPU equivalent of single Xeon/Opteron 1.5GHz
\item single 7200 rpm SATA disk.
\end{itemize}
In order to achieve higher performace, following changes are recommended:
\begin{itemize}
\item Faster disks. Disk access speed is crucial for LB server, couple of 15k rpm
SCSI or SAS disks (one for MySQL database data file, the second for DB logs, LB server's
working directories, and operating system files) or RAID with battery backed 
write-back cache is preferable.
\item More memory. Large RAM improves performance through memory caching,
relative speed gain is likely to be rougly proportional to memory/database size ratio.
To use 3\,GB or more efficiently, 64bit OS and MySQL server versions are recommended.
\item Faster or more processors. CPU requirements scale approximately linearly with
offered load.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Standard installation}

After installation and configuration of OS and basic services
(certificates, CAs, time synchronization), glite-LB metapackage 
from appropriate gLite sotware repository should be installed.
YAIM configuration for \emph{glite-LB} node type 
(\texttt{/opt/glite/yaim/bin/yaim -c -s site-info.def -n glite-LB}) 
can done then. Available parameters specific to LB server are:

%variable&meaning&default value &further details\\
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{MYSQL\_PASSWORD} -- root password of MySQL server (mandatory)
\item \texttt{GLITE\_WMS\_LCGMON\_FILE} -- pathname of file where job state
export data are written for use by lgcmon/R-GMA 
(default: \texttt{/var/glite/logging/status.log}
\end{itemize}
\TODO{add more parameters to YAIM module}

In addition to those, YAIM LB module uses following parameters:
\texttt{INSTALL\_ROOT}, \texttt{GLITE\_LOCATION\_VAR}, \texttt{GLITE\_USER}, \texttt{GLITE\_USER\_HOME},\texttt{SITE\_EMAIL}.

\subsubsection{Migration from previous versions}

\subsubsection{Index configuration}

\TODO{Initial YAIM way only, rest in Sect.~\ref{maintain:index}}

\subsubsection{Server superusers}

Certain administrative operations (identified bellow when appropriate)
on \LB server are privileged.
When they are invoked remotely, a~special authorization is required.
By default, the server identity (X509 certificate subject) is considered
privileged.
Additional subjects can be specified in \emph{superusers file},
specified by \verb'--super-users-file' server option
(one subject per line).
After changing the file, the server has to be restarted.

The default startup script checks for existence of 
/opt/glite/etc/LB-super-users and uses it eventually.

\subsubsection{Exploiting parallelism}

\subsubsection{Tuning database engine}

In order to achieve high performance with LB server underlaying MySQL 
database server has to be configured reasonably well too. 
Default values of some MySQL settings are likely to be suboptimal
and need tuning, especially for larger machines.
These are MySQL configuration variables (to be configured in \texttt{[mysqld]} 
section of \texttt{/etc/my.cnf}) that need tuning most often:
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{innodb\_buffer\_pool\_size} -- size of database memory pool/cache. 
It is generally recommended to set it to aroung 75\% of RAM size
(32bit OS/MySQL versions limit this to approx. 2GB due to address space 
constraints).

\item \texttt{innodb\_flush\_logs\_at\_trx\_commit} -- frequency of flushing to disk.
Recommended values include:
\begin{itemize}
\item 1 (default) -- flush at each write transaction commit; relatively
slow without battery-backed disk cache but offers highest level of data safety
\item 0 -- flush once per second; fast, use if loss of latest updates on MySQL
or OS crash (e.g. unhandled power outage) is acceptable (database remains consistent)
\end{itemize}

\item \texttt{innodb\_log\_file\_size} -- size of database log file. Larger values
save some I/O activity, but also make database shutdown and crash recovery slower.
Recommended value: 50MB. Clean mysqld shutdown and deletion of log files 
(\texttt{/var/lib/mysql/ib\_logfile*} by default) is necessary before change.

\item \texttt{innodb\_data\_file\_path} -- path to main database file. File on
disk separate from OS and MySQL log files (\texttt{innodb\_log\_group\_home\_dir} variable,
\texttt{/var/lib/mysql/} by default) is recommended.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Smoke tests}

\TODO{ljocha: get something from the old testing docs}

Thorough tests of \LB, including performance measurement, are
covered in a~specialized document~\cite{testplan}.
This section describes only elementary tests that verify basic
functionality of the services.

The following test description assumes the \LB services installed
and started as described above.

\def\req{\noindent\textbf{Prerequisities:}\xspace}
\def\how{\noindent\textbf{How to run:}\xspace}
\def\result{\noindent\textbf{Expected result:}\xspace}

\subsubsection{Job registration}

Register a~new job with the \LB server and check that its status is
reported correctly.

\req Installed glite-lb-client package, valid user's X509 credentials.
Can be invoked from any machine.

\how 
\begin{quote}
\verb'/opt/glite/examples/glite-lb-job_reg -m' \emph{my.server.name:port}
\end{quote}
A~new jobid is generated and printed.  Run 
\begin{quote}
\verb'/opt/glite/examples/glite-lb-job_status' \emph{the\_\/new\_\/jobid}
\end{quote}

\result
The command should report ``Submitted'' job status.

\subsubsection{Logging events via lb-logger}

Send several \LB events, simulating normal job life cycle.
Checks delivery of the events via \LB logger.

\req Installed glite-lb-client package, valid user's X509 credentials.
Must be run on a~machine where glite-lb-logger package is set up and running.

\how
\begin{quote}
\verb'/opt/glite/examples/glite-lb-running.sh -m ' \emph{my.server.name:port}
\end{quote}

The command prints a~new jobid, followed by diagnostic messages as the events are logged. 
Check the status of the new job with
\begin{quote}
\verb'/opt/glite/examples/glite-lb-job_status' \emph{the\_\/new\_\/jobid}
\end{quote}

\result
Due to asynchronous event
delivery various job states can be reported for limited time (several seconds).
Finally the
``Running'' status should be reached.

\subsubsection{Logging events via lb-proxy}

Send events via \LB proxy. Checks the proxy functionality.

\TODO{}

\subsubsection{Notification delivery}

Register for receiving notifications, and log events which trigger
the notification delivery. Checks the whole notification mechanism.
