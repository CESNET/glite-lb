We are really sorry that it took us so long to reply to this GGUS
ticket, however we took all the comments and suggestions really
seriously and during the gLite restructuring we made all the required
changes and among others we now have a completely new documentation both
for Logging and Bookkeeping (LB) and Job Provenance (JP).

We attach our comments inline to your initial review/request:

The LB documentation has been changed completely. It is now
part of the org.glite.lb.doc module and it contains four major
documents:

- LB User's Guide (LBUG)
- LB Adminstrator's Guide (LBAG)
- LB Developer's Guide (LBDG)
- LB Test Plan (LBTP)

The official web location for these documents is now
http://egee.cesnet.cz/en/JRA1/LB
and links to these documents were updated on all the following webs:

The old LB User's Guide was removed from
https://edms.cern.ch/document/571273/2

The JP documentation is going to have a similar structure, it is now kept
in the org.glite.jp.doc module and it will be published soon.

The source code of all the examples is now also included in the
glite-lb-client (RPM) together with a simple Makefile so that users
can make the examples on their machines.

LB keeps user tags only as strings, it is left on the
application level to give the values some semantics. It is now
mentioned in LBUG Section 2.3.1.

glite-lb-logevent is now in details described in LBUG, Section
2.3, and the use-case of using this tool to log the user-tag is
described in the LBUG 2.3.1. The logging API is in details described in
LBDG together with the programming examples.

The automatically generated documentation was really unreadable, so we removed
it almost completely from the LBDG. Only a list of header files and important
API functions can be found there.

> I can provide the full source code I used if requested.

We would really appreciate if you could look at the documentation now
and tell us if you find it suitable and if all examples are working for
you without problems.
