This package implements the glite common logging formats
with respect to the gLite common logging recommendations v1.1:

https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/pub/EGEE/EGEEgLite/logging.html

The implementation uses log4c (http://log4c.sourceforge.net) 
and its configuration file log4crc. 

There is one configuration file $GLITE_LOCATION/etc/glite-lb-log4crc
that startup scripts use by setting the LOG4C_RCPATH environment variable.

A file log4crc.example-debugging may be useful to copy to $HOME/.log4crc 
(or by setting the LOG4C_RCPATH environment variable to this file) 
to obtain detailed debugging output.  One can debug only specific parts 
of the LB system, for example by uncommenting LB.SERVER.DB cathegory 
in the log4crc file, one gets only the debugging info related to the 
underlying database subsystem calls.
