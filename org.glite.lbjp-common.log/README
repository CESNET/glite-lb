This package implements the glite common logging formats
with respect to the gLite common logging recommendations v1.1:

https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/pub/EGEE/EGEEgLite/logging.html

The implementation uses log4c (http://log4c.sourceforge.net) 
and its configuration file log4crc. Two examples are provided

- log4crc.example-production - this file is now being installed to 
$GLITE_LOCATION/etc/glite-lb-log4crc and startup scripts 
use it by setting the LOG4C_RCPATH environment variable

- log4crc.example-debugging - this file may be useful to copy to
~/.log4crc (or by setting the LOG4C_RCPATH environment variable
to this file) to obtain detailed debugging output

One can debug only specific parts of the LB system, for example
by uncommenting LB.SERVER.DB cathegory one gets only the debugging 
info related to the underlying database subsystem calls.
